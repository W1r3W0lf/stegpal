# stegpal
This version of stegpal is based on this program [stegpal](https://github.com/jqwalrustitty/stegpal) by [jqwalrustitty](https://github.com/jqwalrustitty).

I found the original program in the 19th article of [POCORGTFO](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/) and thought it would be fun to try to write the core bitmap version of the program in C.

This C based version of stegpal was to get my hands dirty with a cool idea and learn more about C.
